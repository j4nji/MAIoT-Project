🏍️ Motorcycle Lean Angle Sensor

This Android application uses a smartphone's internal sensors to accurately measure and log a motorcycle's lean angle (bank angle) in real-time. It provides a reliable and filtered angle that is robust against sensor noise and inaccuracies.

⚙️ How It Works

The app combines data from the gyroscope and accelerometer using a Complementary Filter.

    Gyroscope: Tracks rapid changes in orientation, capturing the lean of a turn.

    Accelerometer: Provides a stable, long-term reference point using the force of gravity, which corrects the gyroscope's drift.

🚀 Key Features

    Real-Time Display: See your current lean angle live.

    Automated Calibration: Simple routine to zero the angle to your bike's upright position.

    Max Angle Logging: Tracks the maximum positive (right-hand) and negative (left-hand) lean angles.

    GPS Tracking: Visualizes your ride path on a map.

🛠️ Usage

    Mount the Smartphone: Securely place the phone in an upright position on your bike.

    Calibrate: With the bike upright and stationary, press "Start Calibration."

    Track: Begin your ride and press "Start Tracking" to log your data. The app will display your lean angle and maximums.
